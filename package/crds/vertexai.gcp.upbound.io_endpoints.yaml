                                  The metric specifications that overrides a resource utilization metric (CPU utilization, accelerator's duty cycle, and so on) target value (default to 60 if not set). At most one entry is allowed per metric. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is above 0, the autoscaling will be based on both CPU utilization and accelerator's duty cycle metrics and scale up when either metrics exceeds its target value while scale down if both metrics are under their target value. The default target value is 60 for both metrics. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target value 60 if not explicitly set. For example, in the case of Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU utilization to 80, you should set autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to 80.

If this value is not provided, will use min_replica_count as the default value. The value of this field impacts the charge against Vertex CPU and GPU quotas.
